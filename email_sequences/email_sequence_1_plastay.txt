Subject: Stronger, long-lasting PVC compounds with Sunfleks(DOTP)

Hi Ismet,

Itâ€™s impressive to see a bilingual leader in chemical trade who also co-founded a gaming startupâ€”I imagine balancing PVC compounds can feel a bit like balancing game mechanics sometimes.

I also noticed that Plastay exports over 70% of its production globally, with a modern facility producing ~75,000 tons annually. That scale is truly remarkable.

We provide PVC plasticizers (Sunfleks(DOTP), Versafleks(DOP), Med-X(DOP)) designed to enhance impact resistance and weather durability for window profiles and compounds. By combining them with ASMIX, manufacturers achieve significantly longer product lifetimes.

Would you be open to receiving a sample and perhaps arranging a short meeting to discuss compatibility with your product lines?

Best regards,
Ismet

Email 2 â€“ Industry Update (Authority + Meeting Offer)

Subject: EU restrictions push manufacturers to alternative plasticizers

Hi Ismet,

Given Plastayâ€™s strong export focus, I thought you might find this update useful:
ðŸ“¢ The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) recently tightened restrictions on several phthalate-based plasticizers (DEHP, DBP, BBP, DIBP). As a result, many producers are now shifting to non-phthalate, REACH-compliant alternatives.

We supply Sunfleks(DOTP), Versafleks(DOP), and Med-X(DOP), which are designed to keep PVC compounds and profiles durable, compliant, and high-performing in international markets.

Would you be interested in a quick 10-minute call to see how these materials could benefit Plastayâ€™s export-driven production?

Best regards,
Mert

P.S. With Sunfleks(DOTP) + ASMIX, we are helping global manufacturers achieve impact-resistant and long-lasting PVC profiles.

Email 3 â€“ Final Reminder (Soft Close)

Subject: Following up on Sunfleks(DOTP) for Plastay

Hi Ismet,

Just a quick follow-up â€” I previously reached out about PVC plasticizers (Sunfleks(DOTP), Versafleks(DOP), Med-X(DOP)) and how they could support Plastayâ€™s large-scale compound and stabilizer production.

If improving durability and ensuring compliance with EU regulations is something youâ€™re considering, Iâ€™d be happy to send samples or arrange a short call.

If the timing isnâ€™t right, no worries â€” Iâ€™ll step back for now and we can reconnect later.

Best regards,
Mert

Subject: High-performance plasticizers for cable and compound applications

Hi Torsten,

I really liked how Polyplast Müller has scaled from Straelen to Bingen while keeping hands-on expertise in masterbatch and cable compounds. That is a great example of turning regional craftsmanship into global subcontracting strength.

With your 17+ years of experience in procurement and distribution, I thought this might be relevant. We provide PVC plasticizers Sunfleks (DOTP), Versafleks (DOP), and Med-X (DOP) that can significantly enhance durability, flexibility, and processing performance in cable compound and masterbatch applications.

By combining Sunfleks (DOTP) with ASMIX, manufacturers achieve better mechanical stability, improved resistance to external conditions, and extended product lifetime.

Would you be open to a short call and receiving a sample for testing?

Best regards,
Ismet

Email 2 – Industry Update (Authority + Meeting Offer)

Subject: EU moves toward safer plasticizers in cable compounds

Hi Torsten,

As a cable compound and masterbatch specialist, you may find this update relevant. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has tightened restrictions on several phthalate-based plasticizers such as DEHP, DBP, BBP, and DIBP. Many compounders are now shifting to non-phthalate, REACH-compliant alternatives to ensure sustainable market access.

We supply Sunfleks (DOTP), Versafleks (DOP), and Med-X (DOP), which are fully REACH-compliant and help strengthen compound performance, durability, and compliance across industrial applications.

Would you be interested in a quick 10-minute call to explore how these alternatives could support Polyplast Müller’s product portfolio?

Best regards,
Ismet

P.S. With Sunfleks (DOTP) and ASMIX, we support compounders worldwide in producing impact-resistant, durable, and long-lasting cable and compound solutions.

Email 3 – Final Reminder (Soft Close)

Subject: Following up on Sunfleks (DOTP) for cable compounds

Hi Torsten,

Just a quick follow-up. I previously reached out about our PVC plasticizers Sunfleks (DOTP), Versafleks (DOP), and Med-X (DOP) and how they could support Polyplast Müller’s cable compound and masterbatch applications.

If improving durability, flexibility, and EU compliance is on your agenda, I would be glad to provide samples or schedule a short call.

If the timing is not right, that is absolutely fine. We can reconnect later when it suits you better.

Best regards,
Ismet
